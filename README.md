# Pivot-Point-Calculator
An open source key levels calculator for trading. Calculates Pivot Point, Resistance, and Support levels.
Created with python, using tkinter for GUI and openpyxl for writing to Excel. 


Easy to use, straightforward calculator where you just have to enter the High, Low and Close prices for any assets such as stocks or FOREX pairs, and the calculator writes the output to both an Excel file, and a .txt file.
Includes light and dark mode with memory of last used theme. 

Prevents user error by not allowing impossible values to be entered (such as Low price being higher than the High price)
